Given that a knight can two steps forward and one step to the side in any direction:
build a function (knightMoves) that shows the shortest route from one square to another 
outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.

Sample input:                  
knightMoves([3,3],[4,3])    

Sample output:
  => You made it in 3 moves!  Here's your path:
    [3,3]
    [4,5]
    [2,4]
    [4,3]
